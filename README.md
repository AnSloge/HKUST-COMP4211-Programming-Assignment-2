# COMP4211 Assignment 2 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a neural network project for COMP4211 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning) at HKUST.

## Project Overview

This assignment focuses on implementing and training neural networks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes:

- Implementation of neural network architectures
- Training and evaluation on CIFAR-10 dataset
- Analysis and visualization of results

## Repository Structure

```

└── report.docx         # Project report
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
```

2. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. The CIFAR-10 dataset is included in the repository under the `cifar-10-batches-py` directory.

## Usage

Open and run the `code.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to:

- Train the neural network
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize results
